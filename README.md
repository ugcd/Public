## About the UGCD group

The main objective of our Unit is to develop and promote excellent basic and applied research in the genetics of Complex Human Diseases (such as cardiovascular disease, diebetes, osteoporosis, thrombosis, etc.). It must be emphasized that these are extremely important diseases, because they affect many people with great personal health and economic costs. Our primary aim is to transfer knowledge from basic research to the clinic to improve the health and the well-being of the patients.

Our research is multidisciplinary, because it integrates several scientific areas like genomics, genetic epidemiology and gene expression using bioinformatics. In addition, our unit is interested in pharmacogenomics and genetic diagnostics as they impact on complex diseases. Training and education of students and professionals involved with biomedicine is also one of our objectives so that there are personnel to guarantee continued progress in the future.

To achieve our scientific objectives, we design and develop our own projects primarily in basic research to implement new methodologies and tools in genomics, bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology related to complex diseases. In addition, we use these methodologies and tools to study specific diseases of interest to clinicians in the hope of transfering our research results directly to the clinic. We seek collaboration with the biopharmaceutical industry so that the results from our laboratory are quickly transfered to the market place and therefore become available to needy patients.

Our unit strives for nothing less than excellence
